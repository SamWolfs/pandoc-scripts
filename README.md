## Pandoc Installation

### Windows

Don't be silly and use a [Package Manager](https://chocolatey.org/).
Currently not providing **cmd or PS** scripts 'cause lazy and no personal use-case.
`choco install pandoc`

### Linux

Follow the [Pandoc installation manual](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
Scripts don't work on different distros at the moment 'cause lazy and no personal use-case; if I end up using a distro that's incompatible with the current scripts I'll make them distro-portable.
